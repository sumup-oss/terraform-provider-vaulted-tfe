A terraform provider that utilizes https://github.com/sumup-oss/vaulted to provide
https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform for https://app.terraform.io/ (Terraform Cloud/Enterprise) encrypted variables via
`resource.vaultedtfe_variable` that:

* are **never** stored as plaintext in your terraform state.
* are **never** logged in stdout as plaintext.
* can be **safely** stored in SCM such as Git in their encrypted payload format produced by https://github.com/sumup-oss/vaulted .

Tested and used with "public" Terraform Cloud.

## Why should I use this?

At SumUp we're adopting Terraform Cloud with multiple workspaces as our
preferred terraform executor and remote state manager. 

We're already using https://github.com/sumup-oss/terraform-provider-vaulted/ 
 to allow **everyone** inside the organization to provision secrets, 
store them in SCM and CI to provision them.

This enables us to completely shift-left in terms of responsibilities.

However, while moving to Terraform Cloud, we've noticed that we were
 lacking a way to provision the Terraform Cloud workspace variables and 
store them in SCM.
